#Snacks For Med Staff

##This is the Snacks For Med Staff website converted to a series of web pages able to be hosted statically, to reduce cloud compute costs.

Full stack web app to market and showcase fundraising efforts in support of front line medical workers during COVID-19.

This is a website to accompany the #snacksformedstaff 501(c)(3) nonprofit efforts to order food and PPE for medical staff in hospitals across the U.S. and small local restaurants in 2020 during COVID-19. 

Initially a statically hosted 3-page website; now has grown into 5-6 pages including a partner showcase, a form for users to suggest more hospitals for us to donate to, and a detailed analysis of all of our nonprofit fund expenditure to date. 

Tech practiced in the making: Python / Flask / SQLAlchemy, Postgres, HTML5 / CSS/ Bootstrap.
Hosted on AWS EB / RDS.
