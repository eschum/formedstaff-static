                    <p class="card-text">Diane and Willet Feng are two Rice graduates. They opened a fast-casual burger restaurant 
                        called burger-chan, nee Kuma Burgers, back in April of 2016, and soon garnered critical acclaim from food writers 
                        and the general public for their umami-forward burgers and creative toppings, sauces, and shake flavors.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Burger-chan is located in an underground food court in Greenway Plaza and serves as an amenity 
                        for the Greenway Plaza office workers.  Since their built-in office clientele are mostly working from home due to COVID-19, 
                        their business took a big hit.  Burger-chan is currently operating with a limited staff and limited menu available 
                        for takeout, curbside pickup, and in-house delivery within an 8-mile radius.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Since their building is locked from the outside, burger-chan is completely hidden from street view, 
                        they have to pro-actively reach out to our supporters and the community in order to drum up business.  They appreciate every 
                        single order that comes in every single day.
